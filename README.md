## üöÄ Project Overview

This project builds a text classification model to automatically detect spam messages from SMS data. The pipeline includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization)
- Model training using algorithms like **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**
- Model evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Ability to predict whether a new SMS is spam or not

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains labeled SMS messages classified as spam or ham.
