# sms-spam-detector
The goal of this project is to develop a simple and accurate spam classifier for SMS messages.   Using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, the text data is cleaned, vectorized using TF-IDF, and modeled with a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which is a strong baseline for text classification tasks.
